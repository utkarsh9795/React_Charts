React Charts

React Charts is a project focused on implementing various types of charts using React and Chart.js, designed to showcase data visualization with a clean, interactive, and user-friendly interface. This project provides customizable chart components, allowing developers to easily integrate charts like bar, line, pie, and more into their React applications. 

The project demonstrates the use of React's component-based architecture and includes detailed examples of integrating and customizing Chart.js within a React application.

 Features

- Responsive Charts: Each chart adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent look across devices.
- Multiple Chart Types: Supports various chart types including:
  - Line Chart
  - Bar Chart
  - Pie Chart
  - Doughnut Chart
  - Polar Area Chart
- Customizable Options: Easily change chart properties, colors, tooltips, and labels.
- Interactive Tooltips: Each chart includes interactive tooltips, providing more details on data points when hovered.
- Reusable Components: Each chart is implemented as a reusable React component, simplifying the process of adding charts to different parts of the application.
  
 Tech Stack

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, handling the creation and management of chart components.
- Chart.js: A flexible and versatile charting library for rendering various types of charts.
- CSS: For styling the chart components and ensuring a responsive design.

 Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-charts.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-charts
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

 Usage

The project provides a set of pre-configured chart components that you can use directly in your React application. Here’s an example of how to import and use a `LineChart` component:

```javascript
import LineChart from './components/LineChart';

function App() {
  const data = {
    labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"],
    datasets: [
      {
        label: "Sales",
        data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40],
        fill: false,
        backgroundColor: "rgba(75,192,192,1)",
        borderColor: "rgba(75,192,192,1)",
      },
    ],
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Sales Over Time</h1>
      <LineChart chartData={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Each chart component accepts a `chartData` prop, which contains the data and configuration for the chart. You can refer to the `Chart.js` documentation to explore more customization options.
